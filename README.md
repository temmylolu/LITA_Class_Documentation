# LITA_Class_Documentation
This is where I documented my first project while learning Data Analysis with the incubator Hub

---
### Project Overview
In this project, we explore data analysis methodologies using Microsoft Excel, SQL, and Power BI. These tools are widely used for data manipulation, query-based insights, and powerful visualizations. The goal of this project is to showcase an end-to-end data analysis workflow that includes data exploration, transformation, and visualization. By the end of the project, we will produce interactive dashboards and reports to present actionable insights for decision-making.

---
### Key Objectives
1. Data Exploration and Transformation with Excel: Use Excel to clean, explore, and summarize the data. This includes using pivot tables, basic functions, and charts to identify initial trends and patterns.

2. Data Querying with SQL: Employ SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the dataset. SQL allows for efficient data manipulation and aggregation, helping to answer key business questions by breaking down data by categories, dates, regions, and other dimensions.

3. Data Visualization with Power BI: Create interactive dashboards using Power BI to visualize insights discovered in Excel and SQL. The dashboard will allow for real-time interaction, drill-downs, and filtering to uncover trends, performance indicators, and areas of interest.

---
### Tools Used
This project utilizes the following tools and technologies for data analysis and visualization:
- Microsoft Excel: For initial data exploration, pivot tables, and calculations (e.g., average subscription duration, subscription patterns).
- SQL Server: For data storage, querying, and extraction of key insights through SQL queries.
- Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards to visualize customer segments, cancellations, and subscription trends.
- Github for Portfolio Building

#### Text cleaning in Excel

1. Basic Text Cleaning Functions
- TRIM(text): Removes all extra spaces from a string, except single spaces between words.
- CLEAN(text): Removes all non-printable characters from a text string.
- LOWER(text), UPPER(text), and PROPER(text):
   - LOWER(text): Converts all characters to lowercase. 
   - UPPER(text): Converts all characters to uppercase. 
   - PROPER(text): Capitalizes the first letter of each word in a text string.
##### EXAMPLE
- In this spreadsheet, PROPER, LOWER, UPPER, TRIM, and PROPER TRIM Function was used in the name extraction
    - `=PROPER(E6)`
    - `=LOWER(E6)`
    - `=UPPER(E6)`
    - `=TRIM(B6)`
    - `=PROPER(TRIM(B6))`
      
![Basic cleaning functions](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c789a33c-38df-4c73-9a95-80b10a467953)

----
 2. Text Extraction Functions
- LEFT(text, num_chars): Extracts a specified number of characters from the left side of a string.
- RIGHT(text, num_chars): Extracts a specified number of characters from the right side of a string.
- MID(text, start_num, num_chars): Extracts a specified number of characters from the middle of a string, starting at a given position.
- LEN(text): Returns the length (number of characters) of a text string.
  
 ##### EXAMPLE
 - In this spreadsheet, the LEFT  Function was used in extracting the departmental code 
   `=LEFT(B10,2)`
- The MID Function was used in extracting the purchase date code
   `=MID(B16,3,6)`
- The RIGHT Function was used in extracting the Asset category code
   `=RIGHT(B16,4)`

 3. Finding and Replacing Text
- FIND(find_text, within_text, [start_num]): Finds the starting position of one text string within another. Case-sensitive.
- SEARCH(find_text, within_text, [start_num]): Similar to FIND, but case-insensitive.
   REPLACE(old_text, start_num, num_chars, new_text): Replaces part of a text string with a different text string, based on a position and length.
- SUBSTITUTE(text, old_text, new_text, [instance_num]): Replaces occurrences of specific text within a string.
  
  ##### EXAMPLE
  ![Find function](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/667bfc08-17dd-4cce-8ed5-8bb1665e34d7)

4. Text Concatenation
- & Operator: Joins (concatenates) multiple text strings.
- TEXTJOIN(delimiter, ignore_empty, text1, [text2], ...): Joins multiple text values with a specified delimiter.
- CONCATENATE(text1, [text2], ...): Joins text from different cells or strings. (Note: In newer versions of Excel, CONCATENATE is replaced by CONCAT).

5.  Lookup Functions:
   - VLOOKUP
       - This is the lookup value.
       - It refers to the value you want to find in the first column of the lookup range.
       - The dollar signs ($) indicate an absolute reference, meaning the cell reference won't change when the formula is copied to other cells.
       
##### EXAMPLE
- VLOOKUP practical
   - Calculation for the basic salary `=VLOOKUP($E$9, 'Simple Salary Structure'!$B$8:$I$16, 8, FALSE)`
   - Calculation for the Housing `=VLOOKUP($E$9, 'Simple Salary Structure'!$B$8:$I$16, 3, FALSE)`
   - Calculation for the Transport `=VLOOKUP($E$9, 'Simple Salary Structure'!$B$8:$I$16, 4, FALSE)`
   - Calculation for the Leave `=VLOOKUP($E$9, 'Simple Salary Structure'!$B$8:$I$16, 5, FALSE)`
   - Calculation for the Meal `=VLOOKUP($E$9, 'Simple Salary Structure'!$B$8:$I$16, 6, FALSE)`
   - Calculation for the Utility `=VLOOKUP($E$9, 'Simple Salary Structure'!$B$8:$I$16, 7, FALSE)`
   - Calculation  Gross pay `=VLOOKUP($E$9, 'Simple Salary Structure'!$B$8:$I$16, 8, FALSE)`

### DATA VISUALIZATION 
#### Pivot Tables
A Pivot Table is used for summarizing, analyzing, and presenting large datasets. It allows you to organize and manipulate data dynamically to extract meaningful insights, such as totals, averages, counts, and comparisons.

### SQL (STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE)


---

### **1. Database and Table Creation**
- **Database**: 
  - `CREATE DATABASE LITA_DB` initializes a database named `LITA_DB`.

- **Employee Table**: 
  - `CREATE TABLE Employee` creates a table with employee details like `staffid`, `firstname`, `secondname`, `gender`, etc.
  - Primary key: `staffid`.

- **Salary Table**: 
  - `CREATE TABLE Salary` stores salary details including `department` and `salary` with decimal precision.

- **Payment Table**: 
  - `CREATE TABLE Payment` manages payment details, including `payment_method` with constraints for accepted values.

---

### **2. Data Insertion**
- Multiple `INSERT INTO` statements populate the `Employee`, `Salary`, and `Payment` tables with sample data.

---

### **3. Basic Queries**
- Examples include:
  - **Selection**: `SELECT * FROM Employee` retrieves all employee records.
  - **Aggregation**: Functions like `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`, and `COUNT` are used for total salary, average salary, employee count, etc.

---

### **4. Table Modifications**
- **Updating data**:
  - `UPDATE Employee SET secondname = 'Endurance' WHERE staffid = 'AB405'`.
  - Increment salary by 5% using `SET salary = salary * 1.05`.

- **Adding columns**:
  - `ALTER TABLE Employee ADD State_of_Origin varchar(50)`.

---

### **5. Joins**
- **Inner Join**: Combines `Employee` and `Salary` based on matching `staffid`.
- **Outer Joins**: Includes records even if no match exists (e.g., `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL JOIN`).

---

### **6. Unions**
- Combines data from two tables (e.g., `LITA_Store_Lekki` and `LITA_Store_Marina`) while removing duplicates (`UNION`) or retaining duplicates (`UNION ALL`).

---

### **7. Views**
- **Simple Views**:
  - `CREATE VIEW vw_Employee_tbl` simplifies frequent queries by selecting specific columns.
- **Complex Views**:
  - `vw_lita_employee_info` combines data from `Employee`, `Salary`, and `Payment` tables using joins.

---

### **8. Conditional Logic with `CASE`**
- Dynamically assigns categories based on conditions:
  - Example: `CASE` categorizes employees as `Senior Executive`, `Manager`, etc., based on age.

---

### **9. Constraints and Integrity**
- Includes constraints like `CHECK` for valid `Payment_Method` values.
- Ensures data integrity through primary keys, default values, and controlled data types.

---

### **10. Advanced Queries**
- **Filters**:
  - Range (`BETWEEN`), inclusion (`IN`), and exclusion (`NOT IN`).
  - Logical conditions with `AND`/`OR`.
- **Sorting**:
  - Using `ORDER BY` for ascending/descending order.
- **Grouping**:
  - `GROUP BY` organizes data, often used with aggregate functions.

---

### **Summary**
This SQL script demonstrates the end-to-end lifecycle of database management:
- Database creation and initialization.
- Table and data handling with constraints.
- Aggregations, filters, and conditional logic for analysis.
- Efficient organization with views and joins.
